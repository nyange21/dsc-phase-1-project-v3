### Overview
As our company expands into the aviation industry, it's essential to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with aircraft ownership and operation. Our analysis focuses on determining the lowest-risk aircraft for our new business endeavor, considering factors such as safety records. By prioritizing the right aircraft models, engine types, and operational locations, we can minimize risks and ensure a successful entry into this new market.
### Business understanding
That would mean the company wants to minimize risks, optimize investments, ensure safety, and create some sort of competitive advantage in the aviation sector
Further, we need to identify the aircraft models with the lowest risk by developing a risk assessment framework that could inform purchasing decisions.
This business problem being addressed will go a long way in helping the company make informed decisions on which aircraft to purchase, minimizing possible risks and ensuring successful entry into the aviation industry.

### Data Understanding
The data used in this analysis contains data collected from various airports in different countries. It contains detailed information on Aircraft models,Engine type, the aircraft make and how they reate with the type of injuries the aircraft had after an accidents.

The above bar graph shows that the Sportstar model has the highest number of Uninjured passengers.I would rcomend purchase of this model of an aircraft.

Algeria has the highest number of fatal injuries.I would recomend the company not to set its operations in Algeria.


-An interactive dashboard was created for further exploration of this analysis that can be found here

## Evaluation
 Based on the above analysis, I have  recommendations for the company as they seek to enter the aircraft operations industry. The analysis yielded key details on the type of aircraft that has less fatal injuries throughout the years.
 However the recommendations drawn from this analysis should be considered alongside other factors like Aicraft price to ensure the company makes the best decision as it ventures into aircraft operation industry.

# Recomendations
##### The following are recommendations drawn from the analysis done:
##### 1.The company should consider purchasing the Sportstar model.It has the highest number of Uninjured passengers which poses a lower risk to the company.
##### 2.The company should consider the purchase of de Haviland make.It has the highest number of uninjured passengers which also poses a lower risk to the company.
#### 3.The engine type to be considered for purchase is the turbo gun or the turbo jet which are said to have the best performance.The analysis above show that they both had the least number of serious and fatal injuries.The analysis also show that the engines have the highest number of uninjured passangers.
##### 4.I'd recommend the company not to set operations in Algeria.Our analysis reveals that Algeria has the highest incidence of accidents, making it a higher-risk location for our operations.
